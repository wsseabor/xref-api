# Basketball reference API

A basketball reference webscraper factored out of an earlier repo. Integreate with
command line before shutteling back into the intial repo.

Currently scrapes dynamic player stats from basketball reference and saves them in a pandas dataframe. 
Sample image is Damian Lillard's full season stats from rookie 2012 season to the current day. Can be
used for many other current season or past season stats.
