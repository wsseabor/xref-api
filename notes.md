TODO:

    <strike>Include try/catch with error logging for SessionNotCreatedException, TimeoutException in individual
    calls to each class that handles scraping (app/scrapers)</strike>

    <strike>Circular dependency issue</strike>

    Finish classes for all separate stats tables

    Find the correct xpath expression that does not include final rows in certain tables (pp36 awards column)

    Make main function utilize command line, function more "API-like"

    Error logging class?

    Update / install chromedriver on launch (may switch to playwright at later date for browser pools &c. )
