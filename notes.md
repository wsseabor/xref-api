Roadmap:

Initial thoughts:
    
    Main goal is to make a web scraper with Python, the BeautifulSoup library,
    and anything else needed (requests, JSON, etc). Ideally this would be a
    class-based approach as getting all the necessary stats tables would be bestdone as individual classes (i.e., last five stats class, per 36 mins class, season total stats, etc.) 

Initial goals: 
    
    Minimum viable product would simply have a class that wraps around BS,
    and other subclasses of such would be the relevant stat classes. 

    > Main wrapper
        >> Last five class
        >> All other relevant classes along with it
